'''Description: You are tasked with creating a Rectangle class with the following requirements:
1)An instance of the Rectangle class requires length:int and width:int to be initialized.
2)We can iterate over an instance of the Rectangle class 
3)When an instance of the Rectangle class is iterated over, we first get its length in the format: {'length': <VALUE_OF_LENGTH>} followed by the width {width: <VALUE_OF_WIDTH>}'''

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        # Initialize the length and width attributes
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def __iter__(self):
        # Define a generator to return the length and width dictionaries
        yield {'length': self.length}
        yield {'width': self.width}

# Create an instance of the Rectangle class
rect = Rectangle(4, 5)

# Iterate over the rectangle instance
for item in rect:
    print(item)

'''The __init__ method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is created. It initializes the length and width attributes of the Rectangle instance.
The __iter__ method is another special method that allows an object to be iterable. In this case, we use the yield keyword to define a generator that returns two dictionaries: one with the length value and another with the width value.
When we create an instance of the Rectangle class and iterate over it using a for loop, the __iter__ method is called, and it returns the length and width dictionaries in the desired format.'''
